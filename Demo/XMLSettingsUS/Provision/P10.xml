W INSURANCE COMPANY Life is pleased to underwrite Your Weekly Income Disability Benefits which are being provided by Your Employer.  We welcome You to W INSURANCE COMPANY and hope we can be of assistance and guidance to You in the future.
The details of Your Plan are as follows:
ELIGIBILITY
All full time active employees are eligible to join the Plan.
THE BENEFITS OF THE PLAN
This Plan is being provided by Your Employer to ensure ongoing compensation should one if its employees become disabled.
The Plan provides for a benefit to be payable after You have been disabled for a certain length of time.  This time period is referred to as the Elimination Period and is shown on Your Certificate's Schedule of Benefits.
The amount payable under the Plan is shown on Your Certificate's Schedule of Benefits.
BENEFITS PAYABLE
Once an Employee has become disabled and the disability satisfies Us that it meets the Policy definition of Disability, the benefits will be payable weekly after the Elimination Period is completed, and will be paid until the expiration of the Benefit Period shown on Your Certificate's Schedule of Benefits or upon attainment of reaching the maximum age for coverage (stated on the Certificate's Schedule of Benefits); whichever is the earlier.
OTHER INCOME OFFSETS TO BENEFITS PAYABLE
The Benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced by the following other types of income payments which You may be entitled:
--	Any Workers' Compensation Act
--	Any disability income benefits for which You are eligible, e.g., retirement plan, social security benefits, Government retirement plan, etc.

EVIDENCE OF GOOD HEALTH
When You are initially enrolled into the Plan, You may be added for the minimum amount of insurance which can be supplied without evidence of good health.  Upon completion of the medical underwriting and once approved by Us, Your benefit amount will be in
creased to provide the coverage levels shown for Your classification.
From time to time, additional medical underwriting may be required due to Your salary being increased.  Before the insured weekly benefit amount can be adjusted to reflect Your higher earnings, We may require further evidence of good health.  If the additional evidence is approved, the higher benefit amount will become effective from the first of the month following Our acceptance.

DEFINITION OF DISABILITY
